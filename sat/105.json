Additional variables also being measured by Aqua include radiative energy fluxes, aerosols, vegetation cover on the land, phytoplankton and dissolved organic matter in the oceans, and air, land, and water temperatures.\nThe Aqua mission is a part of the NASA-centered international Earth Observing System (EOS). Aqua was formerly named EOS PM, signifying its afternoon equatorial crossing time. A timeline of Aqua on-orbit progress through the initial 120 day check-out period can be found here. Aqua was launched on May 4, 2002, and has six Earth-observing instruments on board, collecting a variety of global data sets.\n"

NOAA-N is the 15th in a series of polar-orbiting satellites dating back to 1978. NOAA uses two satellites, a morning and afternoon satellite, to ensure every part of the Earth is observed at least twice every 12 hours. Severe weather is monitored and reported to the National Weather Service which broadcasts the findings to the global community. With the early warning, effects of catastrophic weather events can be minimized.\nNOAA-N also has instruments to support an international search-and-rescue program. The Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking System, called COPAS-SARSAT, transmits to ground stations the location of emergency beacons from ships, aircraft and people in distress around the world. The program, in place since 1982, has saved about 18,000 lives.\n"

This multi-decadal record has already helped scientists study global sea level rise and better understand how ocean circula-tion and climate change are related.\n\nDeveloped and proven through the joint efforts of NASA and CNES, high-precision ocean altimetry measures the distance between a satellite and the ocean surface to within a few centimeters. Accurate observations of variations in sea surface height-also known as ocean topography-provide scientists with information about the speed and direction of ocean cur-rents and heat stored in the ocean. This information, in turn, reveals global climate variations.\n\nWith OSTM/Jason-2, ocean altimetry has come of age. The mission will serve as a bridge to transition collection of these measurements to the world's weather and climate forecasting agencies, which will use them for short- and seasonal-to-long-range weather and climate forecasting."

These measurements have allowed scientists to detect the spatial variations of both fields as well as their variability with time. The CHAMP mission opened a new era in geopotential research with: 1) mapping of the Earthâ€™s global long to medium wavelength gravity field and temporal variations; 2) mapping of the Earthâ€™s global magnetic field and temporal variations and; 3) atmosphere/ionosphere sounding. As a result, CHAMP data has applications in global climate studies, oceanography, weather forecasting, disaster research, navigation, geophysics, geodesy, and solar terrestrial physics.\n\nCHAMP-derived data serve as an ideal basis for a further refinement of modern satellite surveying methods. They are also useful in remote sensing and cartography applications, such as in the construction of digital terrain models that cover large land and ice areas. The evaluation of all three types of signals that CHAMP observed allows a complete and integrated modeling of the structure and dynamics of the Earthâ€™s core and mantle. Such an improvement strongly enhances studies concerning ths structure and composition of the Earthâ€™s interior and will open new application areas in geodesy, solid Earth physics, and oceanography."
