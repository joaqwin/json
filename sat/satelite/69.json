    "name": "Operation IceBridge",
    "info": "IceBridge utilizes a highly specialized fleet of research aircraft and the most sophisticated suite of innovative science instruments ever assembled to characterize annual changes in thickness of sea ice, glaciers, and ice sheets. In addition, IceBridge collects critical data used to predict the response of earth’s polar ice to climate change and resulting sea-level rise.  IceBridge also helps bridge the gap in polar observations between NASA’s ICESat satellite missions.\nThe objectives are: make airborne altimetry measurements over the ice sheets and sea ice to extend and improve the record of observations begun by ICESat. Link the measurements made by historical airborne laser altimeters, ICESat, ICESat-2, and CryoSat-2 to allow accurate inter-comparison and production of a long-term, ice altimetry record. Monitor key, rapidly changing areas of ice in the Arctic and Antarctic to maintain a long term observation record. And provide key observational data to improve our understanding of ice dynamics, and better constrain predictive models of sea level rise and sea ice cover conditions.\n"
