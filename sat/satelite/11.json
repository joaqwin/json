    "info": "The LAser GEOdynamic Satellite (LAGEOS) was designed by NASA and launched May 4, 1976. It was the first spacecraft dedicated exclusively to high-precision laser ranging and provided the first opportunity to acquire laser-ranging data that were not degraded by errors originating in the satellite orbit or satellite array. LAGEOS-2, based on the original LAGEOS design, was built by the Italian Space Agency and launched on October 22, 1992.The LAGEOS satellites are covered with 426 cube corner reflectors with all but four of these reflectors made with fused silica glass. The other four reflectors are made of germanium to obtain measurements in the infrared for experimental studies of reflectivity and satellite orientation. LAGEOS is a passive satellite with no power, communications, or moving parts. LAGEOS satellite operations consists of simply the generation of the orbit predictions necessary for the stations to acquire and track the satellite. Today, these predictions are routinely generated by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, NERC Space Geodesy Facility, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). The predictions are distributed by NASAâ€™s Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS) and the EUROLAS Data Center (EDC), data centers supporting the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS)."
