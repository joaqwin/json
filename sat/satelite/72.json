    "info": "Every three months, the NASA Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) completes a comprehensive measurement of Earth’s surface, mapping our planet in cool three-dimensional details. It tracks changes to tree canopy heights, ocean and lake levels, and the elevation of ice sheets, glaciers, and sea ice. The ICESat-2 laser pulses 10,000 times a second; each pulse releases about 20 trillion photons. Only about a dozen photons hit Earth’s surface and return to the satellite. ICESat-2's laser is split into six beams, to better measure Earth's surface. "
