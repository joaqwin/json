    "info": "The Modular Optoelectronic Multispectral Scanner (MOMS) is a scanning system (based on CCD technique) for airborne and predominantly spaceborne geoscientific remote sensing application.Most important characteristic of MOMS is the modular arrangement of the CCD-sensor, electronics, optical lens system and filters that allow the instrument to be adapted for completely different geoscientific tasks or missions, as well as the refurbishment of the system between missions as demonstrated in practise."
