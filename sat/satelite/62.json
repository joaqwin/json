    "info": "The CYGNSS mission will use eight micro-satellites to measure wind speeds over Earth's oceans, increasing the ability of scientists to understand and predict hurricanes. Each satellite will take information based on the signals from four GPS satellites.CYGNSS is taking a novel approach to calculate wind speeds that both reduces the mission's cost and gathers more data as well.\nTypically, measuring wind speed over the oceans from space uses a technique called scatterometry. A radar instrument aboard a satellite sends a signal to the ground, and measures the signal strength reflected back to it. Building both sending and receiving capabilities into a single instrument, however, is more expensive than the method being used on CYGNSS.\nThe CYGNSS satellites will only receive signals broadcast to them from GPS satellites already orbiting the Earth and the reflection of the same satelliteâ€™s signal reflected from the earth. The CYGNSS satellites themselves will not broadcast. And according to Chris Ruf of the University of Michigan and the mission's principal investigator, that will result in significant cost savings.\n"
