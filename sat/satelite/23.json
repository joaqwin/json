    "info": "The SIR-C/X-SAR (Shuttle Imaging Radar with Payload C / X-SAR) payload was a cooperative NASA/JPL, DARA/DLR, and ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana) project flown on Space Shuttle Endeavour. The SIR-C/X-SAR project was part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. The experiment is the next evolutionary step in NASA's SIR (Spaceborne Imaging Radar) program that began with the Seasat Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in l978, and continued with SIR-A in l98l and SIR-B in l984. It also represents a continuation of Germany's imaging radar program which started with the MRSE (Microwave Remote Sensing Experiment) flown aboard the Shuttle on the first SPACELAB mission in l983.\n\nThis payload/mission is also known under the name of SRL (Space Radar Laboratory). It consisted of a radar antenna structure and associated radar system hardware designed to fit inside the Space Shuttle's cargo bay. The total payload mass was 11,000 kg with a power consumption of payload sensors of 3 - 9.0 kW. Two Shuttle missions were conducted, each of 10 days duration"
