    "info": "The Tomographic Experiment using Radiative Recombinative Ionospheric EUV and Radio Sources (TERRIERS) project is the second satellite in NASA's Student Explorer Demonstration Initiative (STEDI) program. STEDI, managed for NASA by USRA, is a pilot program to demonstrate that high-quality space science can be carried out with small, low-cost (<$4.4 Million) free-flying satellites on a time scale of two years from go-ahead to launch.\n\nTERRIERS is a collaboration between the Center for Space Physics at Boston University, AeroAstro Inc. (satellite and ground station), the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champain, the Naval Research Laboratory, MIT's Haystack Observatory, Phillips Laboratory and Cleveland Heights High School. TERRIERS' primary goal is to demonstrate meridional 2-D (latitude-altitude) and global 3D imaging of the ionospheric electron density and thermospheric photo-emission profiles using EUV emissions and tomographic techniques. A secondary goal is the study of several ionospheric and thermospheric phenomena and a tertiary goal is to test the utility of a new technique for long term solar EUV irradiance measurements (GISSMO)."
