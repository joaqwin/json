    "info": "Aquarius/SAC-D mapped the salinity (the concentration of dissolved salt) at the ocean surface, information critical to improving our understanding of two major components of Earth's climate system: the water cycle and ocean circulation. By measuring ocean salinity from space, Aquarius provided new insights into how the massive natural exchange of freshwater between the ocean, atmosphere and sea ice influences ocean circulation, weather and climate. Because ocean surface salinity varies from place to place and over time, scientists can use it to trace the ocean's role in Earth's water cycle.\nAquarius/SAC-D was designed to measure ocean surface salinity for at least three years, repeating its global pattern every seven days. During its lifetime, the mission provided monthly maps of global changes in ocean surface salinity with a resolution of 150 kilometers (93 miles), showing how salinity changes from month-to-month, season-to-season and year-to-year. The spacecraft flew in a sun-synchronous orbit 657 kilometers (408 miles) above Earth's surface.\n"
