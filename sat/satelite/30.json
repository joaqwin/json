    "info": "ACRIMSAT was an American satellite to ascertain the extent of solar radiation variability, and was launched by a Taurus rocket from Vandenberg AFB. It carried an ACRIM-3 (Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor) instrument to monitor solar irradiance at high accuracy (<0.1%) as a long term followup to the ACRIM-2 (carried on UARS spacecraft since 1991) and ACRIM-1 (carried on the SMM spacecraft in 1980)."
