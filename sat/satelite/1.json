    "info": "The TIROS Program (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) was NASA's first experimental step to determine if satellites could be useful in the study of the Earth. At that time, the effectiveness of satellite observations was still unproven, Since satellites were a new technology.\nThe TIROS Program's first priority was the development of a meteorological satellite information system. Weather forecasting was deemed the most promising application of space-based observations.\nTIROS proved extremely successful, providing the first accurate weather forecasts based on data gathered from space.\n"
