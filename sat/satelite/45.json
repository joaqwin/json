    "info": "The OCO mission was to provide space-based observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), the principal human-initiated driver of climate change. This mission used mature technologies to address NASA's highest priority carbon cycle measurement requirement. The launch of OCO on February 24, 2009 was unsuccessful due to a launch vehicle failure. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) is planned for a launch in mid 2014."
