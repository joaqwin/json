    "info": "RADARSAT-1 Canada's RADARSAT-1 is a radar satellite featuring variable resolution, and different view angles at a number of preset positions. This sophisticated remote sensing satellite was a Canadian-led project involving the United States. It carries a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), a powerful microwave instrument that can transmit and receive signals to see through clouds and darkness, obtaining detailed images of the Earth. This provides significant advantages in viewing under conditions that preclude observation by aircraft or optical satellites. RADARSAT-1 collects data on resource management, ice, ocean and environmental monitoring and Arctic and off-shore surveillance. RADARSAT-1 also supports fishing, shipping, oil exploration, offshore drilling and ocean research. The RADARSAT-1 provides complete global coverage with the flexibility to support specific requirements. The Radar Satellite (RADARSAT-1) was a joint Canada (Canadian Space Agency/Canada Center for Remote Sensing) and United States (NASA) project. RADARSAT-1 is owned and operated by CSA; NASA provided the launch. RADARSAT was designed to provide detailed information on sea ice and terrestrial ice sheets for climate research, to produce radar imagery for geographical applications in oceanography, agriculture, forestry, hydrology, and geology, and to provide real-time products for arctic ocean navigation including ice surveillance."
