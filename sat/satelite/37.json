    "info": "The GRACE twin satellites, launched 17 March 2002, are making detailed measurements of Earth's gravity field changes and revolutionizing investigations about Earth's water reservoirs over land, ice and oceans, as well as earthquakes and crustal deformations. The two GRACE satellites have completed more than 13 years of continuous measurements!\n\nGRACE is a collaboration of the US and German space agencies (NASA and DLR). GRACE ground segment operations are currently co-funded by the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences and the European Space Agency (ESA). NASA, ESA, GFZ and DLR are supporting the continuation of the measurements of mass redistribution in the Earth system. The key partners in the design, construction and launch of the mission have been the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the University of Texas Center for Space Research, GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, as well as Astrium GmBH, Space Systems Loral (SS/L), Onera and Eurockot GmBH."
