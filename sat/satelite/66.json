    "info": "The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) is a series of instruments designed by NASA to observe stratospheric ozone, aerosols, and water vapor from space. SAGE III is the newest and most advanced addition to the SAGE family. Over the past four decades, the SAGE family of instruments have been critical in making accurate measurements of ozone loss in Earthâ€™s atmosphere. The data collected from SAGE II helped leaders around the world institute an international treaty banning products containing harmful chemicals that destroy stratospheric ozone. SAGE has played a key role in measuring the onset of ozone recovery resulting from the internationally-mandated 1987 Montreal Protocol regulations. SAGE III takes measurements across the globe using a technique called occultation. Every time the sun, or moon, rises and sets, SAGE uses the light that passes through the atmosphere to measure gasses and particles in that region of the atmosphere. From the ISS this happens over 30 times per day.\n"
