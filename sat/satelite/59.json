    "info": "Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO)-2 will be NASAâ€™s first dedicated Earth remote sensing satellite to study atmospheric carbon dioxide from Space. OCO-2 will be collecting space-based global measurements of atmospheric CO2 with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize sources and sinks on regional scales. OCO-2 will also be able to quantify CO2 variability over the seasonal cycles year after year. CO2 is a constituent of the Earth's atmosphere. We know that CO2 is one of several gasses that trap heat near the surface of the Earth. These gasses are known as greenhouse gasses. Many scientists have concluded that substantial increases in the abundance of CO2 will generate an increase in the Earth's surface temperature.\nOCO-2 will be collecting a great number of high-resolution measurements, which will provide a greater spatial distribution of CO2 over the entire globe, in short, a bigger, clearer, more complete picture of global CO2. These measurements will be combined with data from the ground-based network to provide scientists with the information that they need to better understand the processes that regulate atmospheric CO2 and its role in the carbon cycle. This enhanced understanding is essential for improving predictions of future atmospheric CO2 increases and its impact on Earth's climate.\n"
